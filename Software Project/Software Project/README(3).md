# Safety Analysis of Shutdown System in Nuclear Power Plants through Petri Nets

Nuclear power plants are among the most complex and sophisticated engineering systems in the world. 

They require high levels of safety, reliability, and efficiency to operate smoothly and securely. 

Two of the key components that ensures the safe and stable operation of a nuclear power plant is the rod control system, which regulates the position of the control rods in the reactor core and poison injector system which acts as a last resort safety measure to maintain control over reactor. 

A failure of these systems can have catastrophic consequences, such as a meltdown or a radiation leak.
